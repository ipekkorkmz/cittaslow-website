Living slow means being slowly hasty ; “festina lente” latins used to say, seeking everyday the “modern times counterpart” in other words looking for the best of the knowledge of the past and enjoying it thanks to the best possibilities of the present and of the future.

All of this will result in technological opportunities, modern solutions in communication, transportation, incoming, production and selling.

At present living and managing a Slowcity is just a particular way of carrying on an ordinary life-style rather than today’s trends.

Of course this way is meant to be, less frantic, yelding and fast; but there is no doubt that it will be more human, environmentally correct and sensible for the present and future generations; the project will respect small realities in a more and more global connected world.
