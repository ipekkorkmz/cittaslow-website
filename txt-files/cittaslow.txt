Cittaslow is an organization and movement that was inspired by the Slow Food movement that promotes local and traditional food (as an alternative to fast food). Hence, the "slow" moniker. Cittaslow focuses on towns that promote a high-quality, sustainable lifestyle in contrast to an urban lifestyle that harms the environment and puts pressure on people. It supports cultural diversity and uniqueness in towns and regions and is against the idea of settlements and countries becoming ever more homogenized and globalized. Not surprisingly, Türkiye has several “quiet towns,” members of the Cittaslow movement, as the Turkish lifestyle tends to fit within its mandate.
